      <h2>What inspired me to make this site</h2>
      <p>The Indian freedom struggle was shaped by countless brave individuals, many of whom have faded from public memory. 
        Through this website, I hope to honour the life and legacy of one such unsung hero — my great-grandfather.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="early-life">
      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Manindra Bhusan Ghosh was born on 3rd April 1894, in Koramara village of Bagerhat subdivision (now in Bangladesh). His parents were Sphotick Chandra Ghosh and Kamini Sundari Ghosh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Circumstances forced young Manindra (popularly known as Manibhusan) to leave his ancestral home and spend his early years in Rangpur at his uncle Nagendranath Ghosh’s residence. There in 1905, as a school student, he plunged into the Swadeshi Movement in protest against the notorious Carlyle Circular issued by R. W. Carlyle, Chief Secretary of the British Government, which sought to suppress student involvement in the anti-partition movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        He passed the Matriculation Examination from the National Council of Education and graduated from Calcutta University in 1913.

      <h2>Contribtutions to the freedom struggle</h2>
      <p>
        While in Rangpur, Manibhusan joined the Anushilan Samiti — a secret revolutionary society with two main branches: the Jugantar Group in Calcutta and the Dhaka Anushilan Samiti. He became an active member of the Jugantar group, engaged in militant nationalism that included bombings, dacoities, and political resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        He narrowly escaped arrest on several occasions during leaflet distribution and secret communications. On 26th August 1914, the Jugantar group intercepted a shipment of Mauser pistols and ammunition from Messrs Rodda and Co., a Calcutta-based gun dealer. Manibhusan was entrusted with hiding a portion of the stolen arms, which he concealed at Hardinge Hostel.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was arrested in connection with a Swadeshi dacoity in Kurul, Rangpur on 23rd January 1915. Although the revolutionaries buried the stolen loot by a riverbank, he was acquitted due to lack of evidence. He was later arrested again at College Street and Harrison Road junction and was interned on 28th May 1915 — first in Satkhira, Khulna, and then home-domiciled in 1918.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the Defence of India Act (1915), he was subjected to preventive detention and required to report weekly to the Bagerhat Police Station, five miles from home across a river.
      </p>

    <section id="later-years">
      <h2>Later Years</h2>
      <p>
        Following the death of his father in 1919, Manibhusan was compelled to step back from revolutionary activity and fulfill family responsibilities. At 27, he married Sucharu Bala and returned to Koramara to manage his father's land.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though his militant activities had ceased, his commitment to the nation never faded. Until his death in November 1955, he remained devoted to the welfare and development of his village, Koramara.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Government of India recognized his contributions by awarding the Freedom Fighter’s Widow Pension to his wife, Sucharu Bala Ghosh.
